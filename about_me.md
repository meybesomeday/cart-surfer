• Do you have any prior experience working in a team environment? If so, please provide us with details about your experience(s).
---------------------
I have never worked with a remote team, so all of my team-based experience comes from in person work experience in a variety of areas (grocery, health care, warehouse, farm labor, construction). Through all of these experiences I've learned that I consistently perform better when I'm constantly learning new things and helping others. I've been in both team member and team lead positions and am at my best when working together towards a common goal.

• Do you have any prior experience as a Game Engineer? If so, please provide us with details about your experience(s).
---------------------
I don't have any professional experience as a Game Engineer, but game development and programming has been a hobby of mine for many years. I've messed around with many hobby projects and some school projects using an assortment of tools including game engines like Unity, Godot, and GameMaker, as well as programming languages and libraries such as python/pygame, JS, C++, OpenGL, SDL2, etc. I would still consider myself to be beginner/intermediate in most practical areas, but I believe that I have a good fundamental base of knowledge to work from, and that I can learn quickly.

• What experience do you have with Javascript?
---------------------
I spent a few months working daily with Javascript, often many hours per day, mostly thanks to a game on Steam called Bitburner. I still have a lot to learn, but I feel fairly comfortable with scripting and development and very comfortable reading and understanding Javascript code.

• Why do you want to be a Game Engineer for Club Penguin Legacy?
---------------------
Game development has always been an interest and hobby of mine for a very long time, but my interest only goes so far when I'm not working towards a goal I'm passionate about. Club Penguin Legacy brings back a lot of nostalgia from an important and positive part of my childhood, and hosts a wonderful community that I'm very happy to be a part of as an adult. I want to see CPL continue to provide that for everyone, and to thrive as a safe place for so many people out there. Whether it's as a Game Engineer or just a member of the community I hope to do whatever I can to support the continuation of this experience and environment for everyone.

• Why do you believe you would make a great Game Engineer for Club Penguin Legacy?
---------------------
