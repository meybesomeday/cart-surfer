# meyCPL

Club Penguin was a web based 2D massively multiplayed online game that ran from 2005 until 2017. Club Penguin Legacy (CPL) is a community run private server that uses a clean-room reverse engineered recreation of the game.

meyCPL is a private collection of Club Penguin and CPL related projects. It not in any way ofilliated with Disney, Disney's Club Penguin, or Club Penguin Legacy, but is inspired by them as a way to continue learning the art of game design and development, and to potentially be able to give back to a community that has been an enormously positive experience in my life.
